Use the config file to configure the macros.

Example:
Name_of_the_Window = Action Macro

Action 	- Single (button/key to another button/key)
		- Multiple (button/key to several button/key)
		- Script (button/key to a Script)

Macro 	- Single - Key/Button-Key/Button
		- Multiple - Key/Button(Key/Button-Key/Button-Key/Button-...)
		- Script - Key/Button-/path/of/the/Script

If you want use a delay(seconds) use Delay|Key/Button, for example:
Name_of_the_Window = Multiple x(KP_Enter-2|Escape)

To find the keys available using the "keys_available.py" (python key_available.py) 
that prints all the possibilities.

If you want to use a button you can use it by typing "ButtonX" where X is the number
of the button you want to press.
